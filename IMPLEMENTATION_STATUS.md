## 💭 **Recommendations**

### **For Development Team**
1. **Focus on Integration**: Smart contracts are ready, prioritize frontend connections
2. **Start with Core Flow**: Get group joining + NFT minting working first
3. **Use Test Data**: Deploy to testnet and use real blockchain interactions
4. **Iterative Approach**: Get basic flow working before adding advanced features

### **For Project Management**
1. **Adjust Timeline**: Current state suggests 60% more work needed
2. **Prioritize MVP**: Focus on core consortium functionality first
3. **Plan Infrastructure**: Backend services will be needed for production
4. **Consider Scope**: Some PRD features might be post-MVP

### **For QA/Testing**
1. **Start Manual Testing**: Basic flows can be tested now
2. **Prepare Test Environment**: Set up testnet accounts and tokens
3. **Document Issues**: Track bugs as integration progresses
4. **Plan User Testing**: Schedule testing sessions once core features connect

This implementation has a **solid foundation** but needs **significant integration work** to become a functional consortium platform. The architecture is sound and the smart contracts are well-designed, making the remaining work primarily about connecting the pieces together.
